# Cemetery Map Project (Demo)

This is a demo collaboration repo for managing a GeoJSON-based cemetery map.

## Workflow

1. Open `maps/map-latest.geojson` in geojson.io.
2. Make edits (e.g., draw new polygons).
3. Export updated GeoJSON.
4. Save as `maps/map-vX-yourname.geojson`.
5. Update `maps/map-latest.geojson` if it's the new agreed version.
6. Commit/push changes to GitHub.
